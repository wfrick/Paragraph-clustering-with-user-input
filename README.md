# Clustering Article Paragraphs by Sub-Topic

This script clusters article paragraphs by sub-topic, with user input.

The idea is to select a large number of articles about one broad topic (like income inequality), and break them up into key sub-topics so a journalist or reader can easily grasp key themes.
